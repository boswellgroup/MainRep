Welcome to Boswell Research Group's repository page. All of our work is open source, so feel free to fork these projects.

We used Eclipse IDE to work on these projects. The projects can be setup on your personal computer by following these steps:

1. Download Java 8 SDK - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

2. Install Maven build tool - http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi . There are installation steps at the bottom of the page.

3. Install an IDE such as Eclipse Java. Import the project from Git using this URI: https://github.com/boswellgroup/MainRep.git

4. Do a Maven Install on GraphControl to resolve all the external dependencies. In Eclipse, you can do so by right clicking the project -> Run As-> Maven Install. By now, all of the errors should go away. You might need to resolve minor problems such as choosing the right JavaSDK installed on your system.

5. You are ready to go!
