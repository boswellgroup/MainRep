Welcome to Boswell Research Group's repository page. All of our work is open source, so feel free to fork these projects.

We used Eclipse IDE to work on these projects. The projects can be setup on your personal computer by following these steps:

1. Download Java 8 SDK - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

2. Install Maven build tool - http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi . There are installation steps at the bottom of the page.

3. Download the required custom libraries needed to run the projects - https://www.dropbox.com/s/a1faxxc03dgro4n/Javalibs.zip?dl=0 .Extract the Javalibs folder and run maven.bat. 

4. Install an IDE such as Eclipse Java. Import the project from Git using this URI: https://github.com/boswellgroup/MainRep.git

5. You are ready to go!
